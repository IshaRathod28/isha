Design a web page with 7 button to implement the following functionality


	
create a folder
	
Create a file
	
Write the data into a file
	
Append the data into a file
	
Read the data from a file
	
Delete the file
	
Display the contents of the file


The names of the folders, files and the content to be written into the files should be taken as input through the textboxes. And the output should also be displayed on the web page itself



Create 2 sample JSON Files 


➢ The First JSON File should contain Employee Name along with Employee Details and Project ID 

➢ Second JSON File should contain information about the Projects (containing Project ID and Related Details) 


	
Create 2 APIs, providing the following details: 


➢ First API would take the Employee Id as Input and Queries the underlying JSON File to fetch Employee Data at: (localhost:3000/employee/:id) 

➢ Second API would take the Project ID as input and Query the JSON File to fetch Project Information at: (localhost:3000/project/:id) 


	
Using the above specified APIs, create a new API at: (localhost:3000/getemployeedetails ) This API would get the Employee Data along with the details about the project.
	
Update and delete a particular object of a employee


2. Create an Application which displays the Employees List to the user

1. Application will make a call to the API (http://5c055de56b84ee00137d25a0.mockapi.io/api/v1/employees) using Request Object

2. Once the data is available, the employee list along with the details should be visible to the User
